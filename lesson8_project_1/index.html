        <h1>The Major Effects</h1>
        <p><em>The 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico had a tremendous impact on all of the gulf coast states with Florida being among one of the most effected.</em> Not only were industries such as fishing and tourism affected by this major ecological disaster but it also had lasting effects on the housing market. In a report relaesed by <i>ClearCapitol</i>, they have reported that housing brokers along the gulf coast have seen a decrease in the values of the homes in their market by as much as 15%. This major reduction in price can be directly related to the Gulf oil spill as things such as oil washing up on the shores of beachfront properties is now a common occurance.</p>
       
       
<p1>Even in places located hundreds of miles away from where the actual disaster took place they are seeing the market trend downward. For example, in St. Petersberg, Florida real estate agents saw a reduction in sales by as much as 8% which doesn't necessarily sound like a major drop off but in reality that is a major sway in the market. According to the world property journal, in places that saw the highest rate of devestation such as Panama City, Florida there has been a decline by 32.5% in housing sales over the year following the disaster. This just goes to show the full extent that a major ecological disater can have on a region in the short term as well as the long term and the stigma around buying a home in an effected area.</p1>       
       
    
<p>As stated earlier, the areas that have been affected have been stigmatized by potential buyers due to their close proximity to the gulf. As it turns out, not a lot of people are willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on waterfront home when there are large balls of tar and oil washing up on their beaches and around their decks. Peopple would be much more inclined to either wait out the situation and see how the environment bounces back if in fact the results are not irriversable or they will look to buy a home in a different city or state.</p>     
     
     
<p1>In the months following the explosion on the deepwater horizon oil rig that caused the massive amounts of oil to leak into the Gulf of Mexico realitors awaiting the summer time boom saw a massive decrease in the number of people traveling to the gulf coast from out of state. Due to the many health concerns about swimming in and being around the oil filled gulf nearly half of the reservation and bookings for condominiums in the Panama city area were canceled in the years following the spill which brought a major economic downturn to the region. Overall this event has had lasting effects on the gulf coast region that will most likely continue to plague it for many years to come.  </p1>
